# Songhay Web Components

## planting small shadow-tree seeds 🌱👁 and watching them grow in the manner of 🦉 the living standard

The effort here is to centralize all of the standard [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) of my studio. These components are built with [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) and Typescript.

This repository layout is inspired by Google’s work with Lerna [[GitHub](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme)], specifically their `material-components-web` [repo](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web).
